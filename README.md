# Currently working through Neetcodes 150 problems.
see https://neetcode.io/practice for more details. 

## This repo is intended to keep a working list of problems solved as well as alternative solutions. 


###  Process:
Currently I am studying in the morning before work ~5am to ~6:30am before my wife and daughter are awake. This gives me the proper time to focus without distraction.

### New problems: 
I give myself a time limit of 10 minutes. I start by writting down the algo on paper to see if I can sufficently understand the problem and the edge cases. Once I think I have the solution on paper I then code it out. If I am not able to get a working solution on paper after 10 minutes I think its unlikely I will get the solution and thus return to Neetcode.io for problem solutions. 

### Previously solved Problems: 
Following a similar approach to new problems, I give myself 10 minutes on paper to solve it then proceed to code it out. However, In total I will go 20 minutes before looking at solutions. This allows me to really attempt the problem and thus understand the logic of the algo. Moreover it has the benefit of saving time as I dont spend an hour and a half on one problem. 

### Study Pattern.
M W F = new problems. The new problems are pulled from Neetcode.io 
T Th = review of older problems. For this I leverage Anki which has build in spaced repition.
